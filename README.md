# `YamlSigil.v1alpha1` Specification

## tl;dr

`yaml-sigil` defines a user-facing signed in-toto YAML artifact format.
A YAML-form artifact is ordinary payload bytes followed by a final YAML
signature document that can be read (but not validated) without agent
tool calls:

```yaml
some: random
yaml: document
---
schema: YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1
alg: ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL
keyid: <optional lookup hint>
signature: <base64url signature>
```

A spec matching this didn't exist in any other form to the best of my
knowledge. This began as an exploratory effort, found its footing, and
even has a Rust implementation:
[yaml-sigil-traits](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-traits) +
[yaml-sigil-rs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/yaml-sigil-rs).

There are [known deficiencies](#known-deficiencies) here, but they aren't
too rough around the edges in practice.

You're invited to join in helping advance the effort towards a `v1alpha2`
if you'd like to!

## Summary

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/api-flow.png" alt="YamlSigil API flow." width="50%">
</p>

`YamlSigil.v1alpha1` defines two concrete in-toto forms for the same signed
artifact model:

- YAML form: payload bytes followed by a final YAML signature document.
- Protobuf form: serialized `SignedYamlArtifact`.

In both forms the signature covers only the payload bytes. The signature
document carries verification inputs: `schema`, `alg`, `keyid`, and
`signature`. Those fields are not authenticated claims.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `YamlSigil.v1alpha1` defines a payload-signature layer, not a complete
> application security protocol. A `Verified` result authenticates exact
> payload bytes under the verifier's configured key and algorithm policy.
>
> Your human-readable YAML payload can carry purpose and freshness claims. Your
> operating context authorizes the verification key, validates those claims,
> enforces replay policy, and assigns meaning to the verified payload bytes.

## Artifact Forms

`v1alpha1` defines no magic bytes, registered media type, or required file
extension. Callers identify the form out of band.

Form selection is deployment policy, not content sniffing. A deployment that
supports both forms MUST bind each artifact source, route, or storage class to
one accepted form before processing artifact bytes. It MUST NOT retry the same
bytes under the other form after a structural or verification failure, and it
MUST NOT carry a verification decision into a consumer that interprets those
bytes under a different form.

### YAML Form

A YAML-form signed artifact is a UTF-8 byte sequence whose last constrained
marker starts the signature document. A constrained marker is exactly
`---\n` or `---\r\n` at a line-start position.

```yaml
some: random
yaml: document
---
schema: YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1
alg: ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL
keyid: <optional lookup hint>
signature: <base64url signature>
```

Earlier constrained markers belong to the payload stream:

```yaml
some: random
yaml: document
---
some: other-random
yaml: document
---
schema: YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1
alg: ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL
keyid: <optional lookup hint>
signature: <base64url signature>
```

After encoding preconditions pass, YAML-form decomposition is byte-level and
parser-independent:

- No constrained marker produces `Unsigned`.
- A marker at offset `0` is valid and signs the empty byte string.
- A marker with no following signature-carrier body produces
  `MalformedAttemptedSigned`.
- A final constrained-marker span that is not a valid
  `YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1` document produces
  `MalformedAttemptedSigned`, not `Unsigned`.

The full YAML boundary algorithm is in
[Artifact Decomposition](./artifact-decomposition.md).

### Protobuf Form

The protobuf form is serialized `yaml_sigil.v1alpha1.SignedYamlArtifact`:

- `payload` carries arbitrary payload bytes.
- `signature` carries a `YamlSigilSignature` submessage.

The protobuf payload is an arbitrary byte container. The YAML-form UTF-8,
BOM, and trailing-line-terminator rules do not apply to
`SignedYamlArtifact.payload`. A protobuf artifact whose payload does not
satisfy the YAML envelope cannot be transcoded to YAML form.

## The Signature Document

The YAML signature document and protobuf `YamlSigilSignature` are two
representations of the same logical schema. Edits MUST keep
[`proto/yaml_sigil/v1alpha1/yaml_sigil.proto`](./proto/yaml_sigil/v1alpha1/yaml_sigil.proto)
and
[`schema/YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1.schema.json`](./schema/YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1.schema.json)
aligned.

| Field | YAML form | Protobuf form | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | Required string scalar. | Message type. | YAML value MUST be `YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1`. |
| `alg` | Required string scalar. | Required `Algorithm` value. | MUST identify a schema-defined algorithm. |
| `keyid` | Optional string scalar. | Optional string. | When present, MUST be non-empty, at most 1024 UTF-8 octets, and contain no `U+000A` or `U+000D`. It is only a lookup hint. |
| `signature` | Required base64url string scalar. | Required bytes. | YAML uses the profile in [Base64 Requirements](./base64-requirements.md). Decoded signature octets MUST be non-empty before runtime algorithm-support classification. |

### Algorithms

The YAML `alg` scalar uses the canonical name. The protobuf enum uses the
`ALGORITHM_` prefix required by protobuf and Buf style.

| Slot | Canonical name | Protobuf enum constant |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | `ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL` | `ALGORITHM_ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL` |
| 2 | `ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64` | `ALGORITHM_ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64` |

Slot `0`, `ALGORITHM_UNSPECIFIED`, is invalid at runtime. Verifiers map it
to `MalformedAttemptedSigned`. Signers refuse it as
`InvalidOrUnsupportedAlgorithm`.

Per-algorithm rules live in:

- [`algorithms/01-ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL.md`](./algorithms/01-ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL.md).
- [`algorithms/02-ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64.md`](./algorithms/02-ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64.md).

### Conformance Profiles

Verifiers advertise one inner-signature-document conformance profile.

| Profile | Inner signature-document rule |
| --- | --- |
| `Strict` | Reject unknown fields and duplicate known singular fields. |
| `Permissive` | Accept unknown fields. Reject duplicate known YAML mapping keys; apply protobuf's documented singular-field decode semantics. |
| `SignatureStrict` | Reject unknown fields and duplicate known singular fields on the inner signature document, while using the matching signature-strict protobuf outer-envelope mode. |

Every profile applies the same YAML signature-carrier safety requirements
before field extraction. They limit the markerless carrier to 16,384 octets,
require hard parser-resource bounds, disable application-defined tag
constructors, and reject duplicate known mapping keys. The specification does
not prescribe one parser library or one library-specific resource counter.
Full rules are in [Verification API](./verification-api.md).

The advertised profile is a ceiling on permissiveness. A verifier MAY behave
stricter than it advertises, but MUST NOT advertise a stricter profile than it
actually enforces. Full profile rules are in
[Verification API](./verification-api.md).

## Hard Rules

- YAML-form artifact bytes MUST be valid UTF-8 and MUST NOT begin with the
  UTF-8 BOM octets `EF BB BF`.
- YAML-form payload bytes are the bytes before the selected constrained
  marker. They may be empty. A non-empty YAML-form payload necessarily ends
  with `0A` or `0D 0A` so the marker can land at a line start.
- Protobuf-form payload bytes are arbitrary octets.
- YAML Compose MUST reject a signature carrier that contains a constrained
  marker at a line-start position.
- Implementations MUST run form-appropriate structural separation before
  cryptographic verification.
- YAML Verification MUST apply the YAML signature-carrier safety requirements
  before constructing application objects or extracting fields.
- Verifiers MUST return verified payload bytes only for `Verified`.
- Consumers MUST parse only verified payload bytes returned by the verifier,
  not the original artifact.
- `schema`, `alg`, `keyid`, and `signature` are unsigned verification inputs.
  Authenticated claims belong in the payload stream.

## Implementation Note

JSON Schema is the interim validation formalism for the YAML-form signature
document. The protobuf `YamlSigilSignature` message and the YAML-form JSON
Schema MUST stay aligned by hand until alignment tooling exists.

## Verifier States

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Verified` | Structural validation passed and cryptographic verification succeeded. |
| `Unsigned` | YAML form contains no constrained marker. Protobuf form does not produce this state. |
| `MalformedAttemptedSigned` | A signing attempt failed structural, metadata, or pre-crypto validation. |
| `SignedButAlgorithmUnsupported` | The artifact names a valid schema-defined algorithm that this verifier does not implement. |
| `SignedButFailedVerification` | Cryptographic verification was attempted and failed. |

An empty `signature` is `MalformedAttemptedSigned`, including when `alg` names
a schema-defined algorithm that the verifier does not implement.

## APIs

The `.proto` files define the implementor-facing API and wire shapes. They are
API contracts and code-generation surfaces; this specification does not
require public gRPC deployment.

## Security Considerations

`Verified` authenticates only the exact payload bytes under the verifier's
key and algorithm policy. The `schema`, `alg`, `keyid`, and `signature` fields
are untrusted inputs. The signature covers raw payload bytes without a context
string or domain separator, so deployments SHOULD prevent cross-protocol key
reuse.

A signature document inside `verified_payload_bytes` is authenticated only as
payload content, not as a nested artifact verified by the outer result. See the
[Verification API reader-side rule](./verification-api.md#reader-side-rule).

The [YAML Compose carrier-marker check](./transcription-api.md#yaml-profile) is
an emission-time defense. Once the **Artifact** exists, `Decompose`'s required
last-marker selection gives no indication of how an earlier marker entered the
**Payload stream**. Verification can only validate the `payload` and
`signature_carrier` bytes returned by `Decompose`, so it cannot identify
carrier injection as such.

The format carries no freshness, expiry, revocation, or replay claim. An
empty-payload signature is replayable like any other. Put required context in
the payload and validate it after verification. Removing the YAML signature
document produces `Unsigned`; callers that require authentication MUST accept
only `Verified`.

The artifact form is out-of-band and is not signed. Bind the selected form to
the artifact's trust-domain routing or storage metadata before verification.
Do not auto-detect a form from artifact bytes or fall back to another form
after failure.

This specification sets no universal artifact or payload size limit.
Implementations SHOULD bound artifact and payload sizes before buffering or
scanning attacker-controlled input.

Verification imposes a universal 16,384-octet limit on unauthenticated YAML
signature-carrier bytes. Before or during parsing, implementations MUST also
enforce hard limits on nesting depth, constructed node count, and alias
expansion. Parser libraries expose different controls and count these
dimensions differently, so the numeric limits are implementation-defined and
MUST be documented. If a parser cannot bound a dimension, the implementation
MUST reject the corresponding construct before expansion or object
construction. Implementations MUST disable application-defined tag
constructors.

## Known Deficiencies

- `.proto` and JSON Schema alignment is maintained by hand. Automated
  alignment remains future work.
- `VerifyFromPreVerify` appears in the IDL for generated-code consistency, but
  it is an in-process and same-instance concept, not a public RPC deployment
  surface.
- Strict inner-protobuf conformance is not reliably available from stock
  protobuf parsers. Implementations that cannot reject unknown fields and
  duplicate known singular fields honestly advertise `Permissive`.
- YAML Decompose cannot finalize the payload boundary before EOF because it
  selects the last constrained marker.

## Open Decisions

Future algorithm entries that require per-artifact-varying parameters must
define how those parameters are carried. The current `v1alpha1` algorithms
define no on-wire algorithm parameters.

## Future Enhancements

These items are outside the current `v1alpha1` conformance contract, but
remain plausible later extensions:

- Multi-signature support, probably as repeated signature entries inside one
  signature document. Multiple appended signature documents conflict with the
  last-marker YAML decomposition rule.
- DSSE transport or PAE-aligned signing, if a future version chooses to sign a
  framed payload commitment rather than raw payload bytes. That would require
  explicit mapping among DSSE `Envelope`, `SignedYamlArtifact`, and the YAML
  artifact layout.
- Formal `keyid` profiles for common key identifiers, including the encoding
  and length rules needed for interoperable lookup.
- Per-form conformance advertising, so an implementation can state stricter
  YAML behavior than protobuf behavior when its protobuf parser cannot enforce
  strict inner-message rules.
- Alternate human-oriented encodings, such as base58btc, if a future key or
  signature profile needs them and can cite stable specifications.

## Out of Scope

This format does not define key discovery, key rotation, key revocation,
transparency, replay protection, context binding, or multi-party approval.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Artifact** | The input byte sequence evaluated by this specification. |
| **Artifact (abstract)** | The format-free pair `(payload_bytes, signature_carrier_bytes)`. |
| **Payload stream** | The exact bytes covered by the signature. |
| **Signature document** | The YAML construct that carries `YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1` metadata. In YAML form it is marker-inclusive. In protobuf form the analogue is the `signature` submessage in `SignedYamlArtifact`. |
| **Signature carrier** | The markerless bytes that cross the Transcription API boundary. In YAML form this is the signature document with the constrained marker removed. In protobuf form it is the length-delimited body of the outer `signature` submessage. |
| **Verified payload bytes** | The exact bytes returned by successful verification. |
| **Transcription** | The bytes-only envelope process that composes and decomposes YAML or protobuf forms. |
| **Transcoding** | Round-tripping between YAML and protobuf forms. |
| **Artifact Decomposition** | The byte-level YAML algorithm that separates a YAML-form artifact into payload and signature ranges. |
