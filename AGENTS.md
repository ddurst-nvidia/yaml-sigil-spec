# AGENTS.md

## Maintainer operations

Ordinary repository work does not require the maintainer guide. Before
performing or advising on hosted maintainer operations—authorizing pull-request
tests, merging, activating or synchronizing a coordination line, exceptional
integration, or reverting `main`—read
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md) completely.

Whenever a workflow or supporting policy changes, update the matching
procedure in `MAINTAINERS.md` in the same change. Keep that runbook concise,
coherent, and aligned with the executable behavior.

Use [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to choose `main` or an advertised
next-line coordination base before starting work. Keep compatible and
protected-policy changes on `main`; target the active coordination branch only
for next-line work. A coordination branch never supplies its own CI policy.

## Agent Documentation Standards

Project-local skills exist under `.agents/skills/` and should remain
discoverable by agents working in this repository. Maintain those skills
according to the
[Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), and
maintain this file according to the
[AGENTS.md standard](https://agents.md/). Keep both portable across compatible
agent clients, without assumptions about user-specific paths or session state.

Use `.agents/skills/update-non-normative/SKILL.md` when updating or reviewing
non-normative companion material after specification changes, including
diagrams, schema-adjacent documentation, conformance indexes, examples, and
cross-references.

## Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits for every commit. Format the subject as
`<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`, keep it under 72 characters, and
choose the smallest accurate type. Follow the sign-off requirements in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Repository scope

This repository is a **specification**: the normative deliverables are
Markdown and protobuf schema, not application source code. The day-to-day
work is reading, writing, and refining those specification documents.

## Third-party material and attribution

`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is the canonical attribution and redistribution
record for standards text, test vectors, parameters, tables, and other
third-party material included in this repository. NVIDIA-authored material is
licensed under Apache-2.0; do not describe identified third-party material as
relicensed under Apache-2.0.

Classify a use before treating it as added or changed third-party material:

- Copied or closely adapted expressive text, code, test vectors, tables,
  non-trivial data, or constants require a source and terms review.
- A citation, hyperlink, standard or dependency name, interface identifier,
  interoperability requirement, or statement of a conventional technical fact
  does not by itself require a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` entry. Keep a precise
  citation near the use when it helps implementers or auditors.
- Do not duplicate a complete, self-contained notice merely to catalog it.
  Material that already carries its source, copyright notice, and copying
  condition in the same independently distributed file does not need a second
  entry unless its terms require one. In particular, the complete unchanged
  Developer Certificate of Origin in `CONTRIBUTING.md` does not need a
  duplicate entry.
- For dependencies and container base packages, prefer exact upstream notice
  files collected or installed automatically from the locked build. Keep the
  repository notice attached to a distributed binary, but do not maintain a
  hand-copied crate or operating-system package inventory when those exact
  notices travel with the artifact automatically.

When adding or changing third-party material:

- Update `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` in the same change. Record the exact source,
  version, section, copyright holder, applicable copying conditions, warranty
  disclaimer, and patent or other intellectual-property caveat.
- Record only terms the source actually states. Do not add speculative
  boilerplate about absent terms.
- Read the source's own copyright notice and terms. For an RFC, check its
  publication stream and the BCP 78 or IETF Trust terms in effect on its
  publication date. Do not assume that RFC test data, tables, ABNF, or code
  blocks are IETF Code Components or covered by a BSD license.
- Copy only the material needed to specify, implement, or test conformance.
  Prefer a precise citation and a short excerpt over reproducing a full table
  or section.
- Ensure every file or other independently distributed material that mentions
  or references either SEC source identifies it by its full title:
  *Standards for Efficient Cryptography 1 (SEC 1)* or
  *Standards for Efficient Cryptography 2 (SEC 2)*.
  Use the full title on the first source reference in each file; the `SEC 1`
  and `SEC 2` short forms may follow within that file.
- Add a short provenance comment next to copied or derived constants and in
  generated text when the format permits comments. State when the identified
  values are not covered by the file's Apache-2.0 declaration.
- Do not alter semantic fixture bytes to add attribution. For binary files,
  signed artifacts, parser inputs, or other exact-byte fixtures, put the
  provenance in the nearest `README.md`, a safe sidecar, and the authoritative
  generator source.
- Preserve applicable non-endorsement language. Do not present YamlSigil as an
  official publication of, or as affiliated with or endorsed by, a cited
  author, publisher, or standards organization.

Keep these instructions durable and repository-focused. Do not record private
correspondence, reviewer identities, or approval history in repository
documentation. After an approved specification change is merged, propagate
the canonical notice through the documented downstream import workflows.

## Document hierarchy

The repository contains **normative** documents at two levels of normativity.
Treat them differently.

### Working specification

- **[README](./README.md)** — the working specification for `YamlSigil.v1alpha1`.
  Contains the glossary, compact artifact examples, format-level rules,
  verifier-state summary, reference index, and the open items still to be
  decided, alongside the normative **Hard Rules Overview** (UTF-8 only, YAML
  1.2 scoped per role, form-appropriate
  structural separation before crypto via the Transcription API — Artifact
  Decomposition for YAML form, `SignedYamlArtifact` outer-envelope decode
  for protobuf form) and a brief enumeration of the Verification API states
  (full definitions live in the companion specification). The README is
  the canonical source for terminology and the format-level rules; for
  the byte-level decomposition algorithm, the Transcription API envelope
  contract, transcoding round-trips, and the verifier API contract,
  consult the hard reference specifications below.

### Hard technical reference specifications

- **[Artifact Decomposition](./artifact-decomposition.md)** — normative
  byte-level YAML implementation reference for the
  [Transcription API](./transcription-api.md)'s `Decompose` operation.
  Covers encoding requirements, the constrained marker profile, the
  decomposition algorithm, failure modes, and the verifier-API state
  mapping. When in doubt about YAML boundary detection, encoding, the
  marker rule, or YAML decomposition outcomes, this document is
  authoritative.

- **[Base64 Requirements](./base64-requirements.md)** — normative
  profile for base64 encoding of the YAML-form `signature` field in
  `YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1` (URL-safe alphabet, no padding, no
  non-zero trailing bits in the final partial quantum). When in doubt
  about YAML `signature` base64 encode/decode policy, this document is
  authoritative.

- **`proto/yaml_sigil/v1alpha1/yaml_sigil.proto`**
  — normative artifact wire schema for the protobuf form. Defines the
  `SignedYamlArtifact` and `YamlSigilSignature` messages and the
  `Algorithm` enum in package
  `yaml_sigil.v1alpha1`. The strict signature-document
  schema in protobuf form is `v1alpha1.YamlSigilSignature` here. When
  in doubt about the wire shape, message types, field numbers, or
  enum values, the `.proto` file is authoritative. The schema is not
  embedded elsewhere in the repo (this is a deliberate
  single-source-of-truth choice; so [README](./README.md) and
  the API design documents link to this file rather than duplicating its
  contents).

  The `proto/` tree is governed by `proto/buf.yaml` (buf v2 format)
  using the full `STANDARD` lint rule set with no exceptions.
  `buf build proto`, `buf lint proto`, and
  `buf format proto --diff --exit-code` MUST pass on every change.

- **`schema/YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1.schema.json`** — the working
  enumeration of the YAML-form strict signature-document shape for
  `YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1`, written against the IETF JSON Schema
  draft. Normative for the schema *shape* (must stay aligned with the
  protobuf `v1alpha1.YamlSigilSignature` above). **JSON Schema is the
  spec's interim validation formalism** for the YAML form; the
  reasoning is in [README](./README.md)'s Implementation Note and in
  [`schema/README.md`](./schema/README.md). Mechanizing the alignment
  between the `.proto` and the YAML-form schema (the natural path is
  `protovalidate`) is tracked under Known Deficiencies.

  **Alignment of the two schemas.** The protobuf `v1alpha1.YamlSigilSignature`
  and the YAML `YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1` JSON Schema are two
  reifications of the same logical schema. **They MUST be kept
  aligned**: a change to one MUST be accompanied by a matching change
  to the other. A formal alignment process (automated checks,
  cross-validation tooling, conformance tests) cannot exist until both
  representations are written by hand first — that is why both are
  written by hand now. Mechanizing the alignment is future work; the
  artifacts have to exist before any process can validate them against
  each other. Edits SHOULD start with the `.proto` representation and
  replicate into the JSON Schema; see
  [`schema/README.md`](./schema/README.md). For `alg`, the canonical
  names and the protobuf-prefix convention are pinned in
  [README](./README.md)'s "The Signature Document" section.

- **`proto/yaml_sigil/v1alpha1/transcription.proto`**
  — authoritative IDL for the Transcription API surface. Defines
  `TranscriptionService`, request and response messages,
  `TranscriptionForm`, `OuterConformance`, decomposition outcomes, and
  transcriber error enums. When in doubt about the exact transcription
  method shape, field numbers, enum values, or implementor-facing field
  contract, this file is authoritative. The service definition is an API
  contract and code-generation surface; it does not require every
  conforming implementation to expose public gRPC.

- **[Transcription API](./transcription-api.md)** — normative
  specification of the Transcription API design model: the abstract
  Artifact, bytes-only Compose/Decompose contracts, YAML and protobuf
  profiles, outer-envelope conformance behavior, structural failure
  mapping, and explicitly named anti-patterns. Exact method, message,
  enum, field, and service-contract shapes live in `transcription.proto`.
  Inner-`YamlSigilSignature` interpretation and inner conformance live
  in `verification-api.md`, not here.

- **[Transcoding](./transcoding.md)** — normative specification of
  YAML ↔ protobuf round-trip behavior as a two-layer orchestration over
  the Transcription API (envelope) and the Verification API
  (signature-carrier interpretation). Covers the round-trip step tables,
  canonical YAML carrier emission, round-trip properties, verification
  path independence, and the open v1 commitment items that block
  byte-identical interop.

- **`proto/yaml_sigil/v1alpha1/signing.proto`**
  — authoritative IDL for the Signing API surface. Defines
  `SigningService`, request and response messages, signer capability
  fields, `OutputForm`, and signer error enums. When in doubt about
  the exact signing method shape, field numbers, enum values, or
  implementor-facing field contract, this file is authoritative.
  The service definition is an API contract and code-generation
  surface; it does not require every conforming implementation to
  expose public gRPC.

- **`proto/yaml_sigil/v1alpha1/verification.proto`**
  — authoritative IDL for the Verification API surface. Defines
  `VerificationService`, request and response messages, verifier
  states, pre-verification result types, invocation-error enums, and
  metadata fields. When in doubt about the exact verification method
  shape, field numbers, enum values, or implementor-facing field
  contract, this file is authoritative. The service definition is an
  API contract and code-generation surface; it does not require every
  conforming implementation to expose public gRPC. In particular,
  `VerifyFromPreVerify` is an in-process/same-instance API concept,
  not a public RPC deployment surface.

- **[Signing API](./signing-api.md)** — normative specification of the Signing
  API design model: signer inputs, validation phases, signer-side
  errors, output contract, best-effort YAML 1.2 validation at sign
  time, signing flow, signature-document-is-unsigned-input rule,
  empty payload handling, cross-form independence, and explicit
  signer-side anti-patterns. Exact method, message, enum, field, and
  service-contract shapes live in `signing.proto`.

- **[Verification API](./verification-api.md)** — normative specification of the
  Verification API design model: the five distinguishable verifier
  states, invocation-error surface, return contract, reader-side rule,
  stage attribution, cross-form independence, optional pre-verification
  helpers, and explicitly named anti-patterns. Exact method, message,
  enum, field, and service-contract shapes live in `verification.proto`.
  Used for both YAML and protobuf forms via the
  [Transcription API](./transcription-api.md)'s `Decompose` outcomes.

- **[`algorithms/01-ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL.md`](./algorithms/01-ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL.md)**
  — normative specification of the
  `ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL` algorithm (slot 1). Pure EdDSA
  over edwards25519, deterministic signing, raw 64-octet `R ‖ S`,
  strict canonical-encoding verification per
  ["Taming the Many EdDSAs"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1244)
  Algorithm 2 (cofactored equation only). Slot assignment lives in
  [README](./README.md)'s "The Signature Document"; per-algorithm
  conformance rules (key encoding, wire format, signing / verification
  steps, S-component policy, test vectors) live in the algorithm
  document.

- **[`algorithms/02-ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64.md`](./algorithms/02-ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64.md)**
  — normative specification of the `ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64`
  algorithm (slot 2). ECDSA over secp256r1 (NIST P-256), SHA-256, fixed
  64-octet raw `R ‖ S`, non-deterministic ephemeral nonce per FIPS 186-5
  §6.3. Slot assignment in [README](./README.md); per-algorithm rules
  in the algorithm document.

These hard references — the Markdown references, the protobuf files,
the YAML JSON Schema, and the two algorithm specifications — together
with [README](./README.md) are intended to be tight enough that two
independent implementations agree on every conformance question they
cover.

### History (non-normative)

- **`original-readme.md`** — the historical starting point of the
  repository, preserved for lineage. Not normative.

### Diagrams and visual aids (non-normative)

The diagrams below are illustrative companions to the normative
documents. They MUST be kept in sync with the documents they
illustrate, but they are not themselves authoritative; if a diagram
and a normative document disagree, the document wins.

- **[`DIAGRAM.md`](./DIAGRAM.md)** — full end-to-end mermaid view of
  the Signing, Transcription, and Verification API surfaces.
  Companion to the three `*-api.md` design documents and the three
  API `.proto` IDLs. **Maintenance:** any change to a method name,
  state, outcome category, invocation-error category, or stage
  attribution in `signing-api.md`, `transcription-api.md`,
  `verification-api.md`, or [`transcoding.md`](./transcoding.md)
  requires a matching update to `DIAGRAM.md`.

- **[`images/api-flow.svg`](./images/api-flow.svg)** /
  **[`images/api-flow.png`](./images/api-flow.png)** — the
  higher-level Signing → artifact → Verification flow embedded in
  [README](./README.md). **Maintenance:** keep in sync with the
  three `*-api.md` design documents whenever the high-level method
  boundaries shift.

- **[`images/yaml-artifact-transcription-diagram.svg`](./images/yaml-artifact-transcription-diagram.svg)**
  /
  **[`images/yaml-artifact-transcription-diagram.png`](./images/yaml-artifact-transcription-diagram.png)**
  — narrower YAML-form byte-range diagram showing
  `payload_range`, the constrained marker, `signature_carrier_range`
  (markerless), and `signature_document_range` (marker-inclusive)
  across four canonical artifact shapes (signed single document,
  signed multi-document, unsigned, empty-payload signed).
  **Maintenance:** update whenever
  [`artifact-decomposition.md`](./artifact-decomposition.md) renames
  a byte range, the constrained marker profile changes, the
  canonical artifact shapes in [`README.md`](./README.md) or
  [`transcription-api.md`](./transcription-api.md) change, or the
  glossary terms `Signature document` / `Signature carrier` shift.
  The SVG header carries the per-change checklist and the PNG
  rebuild command.

### Implementation kit (non-normative)

See
[`implementation-kit/AGENTS.md`](./implementation-kit/AGENTS.md).

### Conformance fixtures (normative)

The `conformance/` tree carries static fixtures auditors and
implementers use to validate behavior end-to-end. See
[`conformance/AGENTS.md`](./conformance/AGENTS.md) for the per-
subdirectory maintenance contract; in brief, the fixture subdirectories
ship only data — a single Rust generator crate at
[`conformance/rebuild-rs/`](./conformance/rebuild-rs/) reproduces every
fixture bit-identically, with per-spec-surface modules under its `src/`
tree. Upstream-source citations (RFC, FIPS, *Standards for Efficient
Cryptography 1 (SEC 1)*, NIST CAVP / ACVP, "Taming the Many EdDSAs", etc.)
live in the per-subdirectory `README.md` and in the rustdoc of the matching
`src/` module.

**Rule for spec edits:** any change to a normative document that
alters input bytes, expected outcomes, enum membership, or stage
attribution MUST be followed by a conformance pass in the affected
subdirectories. The cross-table:

| Spec change | Affected `conformance/` subdirectory |
| --- | --- |
| `artifact-decomposition.md`, README's artifact-layout examples, constrained marker profile | `yaml-decomposition/` |
| `transcription-api.md`, `transcription.proto`, `yaml_sigil.proto` wire shape, `OuterConformance` enum, protobuf-form inner conformance rules | `protobuf-conformance/` |
| `verification-api.md` YAML signature-carrier safety and Conformance Profile rules (bounds, duplicate known keys, unknown keys, parser resources, tags) | `yaml-signature-conformance/` |
| `verification-api.md` runtime algorithm support and cryptographic result mapping | `verification-runtime/` |
| `transcoding.md` canonical YAML carrier and YAML ↔ protobuf round-trip rules | `transcoding/` |
| `Algorithm` enum membership, YAML `alg` string mapping, README's "The Signature Document" alg table | `schema-alignment/` |
| `keyid` constraints (README, `yaml_sigil.proto`, `signing.proto`, `verification.proto`, JSON Schema) | `key-id/` |
| `base64-requirements.md` | `base64/` |
| `algorithms/01-ED25519_PUREEDDSA_RAW_RS64_CANONICAL.md` | `alg-ed25519/` |
| `algorithms/02-ECDSA_SECP256R1_SHA256_RAW_RS64.md` | `alg-ecdsa/` |

An auditor of the specification SHOULD be able to validate every
shipped fixture against its upstream source by running the
[`conformance/rebuild-rs`](./conformance/rebuild-rs/) rebuilder and
diffing the output. If a normative change is merged without the
corresponding conformance update, treat it as a defect.

## How to work in this repo

- **For technical questions** about the format (what's signed, what the
  byte layout is, how API calls are shaped, how verification works, how
  transcription works):
  consult the hard technical references first. The README provides
  intent; the hard references provide rules.
- **For design questions** (why was this choice made, what alternatives
  were considered): read the README and the analysis directory.
- **When the README and a hard reference disagree**: this is a defect.
  Flag it. The hard reference is authoritative for conformance, but a
  divergence between the two indicates one or the other needs an
  update.
- **When making changes**: keep cross-references consistent. The
  primary documents and relevant proto comments use the same glossary terms (**Artifact**,
  **Payload stream**, **Signature document**, **Verified payload
  bytes**, **Artifact Decomposition**). Renaming a term means updating
  all affected documents.
- **When editing normative Markdown** (everything under this repo except
  `original-readme.md`): follow
  the **Style guide** section below (voice, formatting, word list).
  Use GitHub Flavored Markdown as the source dialect unless a file
  documents a narrower renderer requirement.
  Run `rumdl check` on touched files before landing.

### CI validation

Run the complete repository-owned, non-release validation sequence from the
repository root:

```shell
cargo xtask ci
```

To apply the validator from the current checkout to another repository
checkout, pass its root explicitly:

```shell
cargo xtask ci --candidate-root PATH
```

The command still builds and runs the xtask from the current checkout; only
the repository content being validated comes from `PATH`.

The command runs these checks in order:

```shell
rumdl check .
buf build proto
buf lint proto
buf format proto --diff --exit-code
jq empty schema/YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1.schema.json
(
  cd conformance/rebuild-rs
  cargo fmt --all --check
  cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  cargo test --locked --workspace --all-features
)
cargo-machete --with-metadata
(
  cd conformance/rebuild-rs
  cargo-deny --locked --workspace check bans licenses sources -D warnings
  cargo audit
)
```

Install `rumdl`, `cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny`, and `cargo-machete` with Cargo,
and install `jq`, before running the wrapper:

```shell
cargo install rumdl
cargo +1.98.0 install --locked cargo-audit --version 0.22.2
cargo install --locked cargo-deny --version 0.20.2
cargo install --locked cargo-machete --version 0.9.2
```

Keep the cargo-audit, cargo-deny, and cargo-machete versions aligned with
hosted CI. Cargo Deny reads the repository-wide policy from `deny.toml` and
the workspace-specific license exceptions from
`conformance/rebuild-rs/deny.exceptions.toml`. The locked workspace check
covers the rebuilder, its local helper crate, and the developer xtask. The
`--with-metadata` check resolves normal, development, and build dependency
names across all features, but remains an unused-dependency heuristic; retain
the all-target, all-feature Clippy and test checks as the compilation proof.

For Buf, the xtask uses the executable named by `BUF` when set, then searches
`PATH`, and confirms that the selected executable can run. Local development
retains a rolling latest release policy, while hosted workflow configuration
pins Buf CLI `1.72.0` as a separate control. Install or update the latest
`buf-toolchain` release and ensure `$CARGO_HOME/bin` is on `PATH`:

```shell
cargo install --force buf-toolchain
```

See the [official Buf installation instructions](https://buf.build/docs/cli/installation/)
for other installation methods. Keep the rolling Buf version policy and exact
local validation sequence aligned between
`conformance/rebuild-rs/xtask/src/ci.rs` and this file.

Keep `cargo xtask ci` provider-neutral. It must not read, parse, or test a
hosted CI provider's configuration. Its tests should validate the
repository-owned command plan and actionable prerequisite guidance. Hosted CI
may declare the same checks as independent steps, but behavioral alignment is
a review responsibility rather than a source-level dependency between the
xtask and a provider configuration file.

Hosted CI is Linux-only. Pushes to `main`, `ci-testing/*`, and an activated
canonical specification coordination ref run non-publishing CI on an NVIDIA
Linux runner. Pull-request code runs only after `copy-pr-bot` copies an exactly
reviewed head to `pull-request/<number>`. The candidate job binds the open pull
request, copied ref, canonical pull head, exact contribution base, and
protected current `main` before materialization. It installs Rust `1.98.0`,
cargo-audit `0.22.2`, and
cargo-deny `0.20.2` before materializing source, checks out without
credentials, Git filters, LFS, or candidate-selected submodules, requires a
fresh empty runner-temporary source root, and permits root Cargo configuration
only when it is identical to protected current `main`. It has no secret, OIDC,
protected environment, cache-save, or retained-artifact path.

The checkout-free `Required CI reporter` runs from protected `main` on a
GitHub-hosted Linux runner. It binds the completed CI workflow ID and path,
exact protected workflow blob, live protected-main and pull-request base,
repository, push event, run ID and attempt, open pull request, copied ref,
current head, exact raw-author DCO identities, unique authoritative Linux job,
terminal conclusion, and zero artifacts. The authoritative job name must
attest the protected-policy and base objects captured before candidate
execution. Only after exactly repeating that binding may the repository's
GitHub App create `Required CI` for `main` or
the coordination ref's distinct base-specific required verdict on the exact
head. A verdict for one base must not satisfy another.

Python is permitted here only for the pre-checkout candidate binder, the
checkout-free protected reporter, and their deterministic fixtures. Those
policies must run before candidate materialization or App-token creation, as
applicable, and must not compile candidate-controlled Rust. Every Python file
added or materially changed must begin with comments explaining why Python is
justified at that boundary, then document its inputs, trust assumptions,
outputs, mutations, and fail-closed behavior. Keep it standard-library-only
unless a separately reviewed dependency is demonstrably needed. Use a
provider-neutral Cargo xtask for repository validation or maintenance logic
that does not require this pre-checkout boundary.

Keep `.github/scripts/materialize-candidate.sh`, its focused offline test,
`.github/scripts/install-actionlint.sh`, and
`.github/scripts/check-pull-request-commits.sh` identical across
`yaml-sigil-spec`, `yaml-sigil-traits`, and `yaml-sigil-rs`. The commit helper
checks the exact current-base range for merge commits and matching DCO
sign-offs. Keep both Python policy helpers and their focused fixture tests
byte-identical as well; repository constants belong in protected workflow
arguments. Hosted Rust caches may retain Cargo registry source data, but must
not retain target directories or compiled executable outputs.

Validate shell scripts under `.github/scripts` with Shuck before landing
changes. Install it from the `shuck-cli` crate and run it from the repository
root:

```shell
cargo install shuck-cli
shuck check .github/scripts
```

ShellCheck is an acceptable fallback:

```shell
shellcheck .github/scripts/check-pull-request-commits.sh
```

Hosted CI runs its pinned ShellCheck Action for these provider-specific scripts.
Keep this validation outside `cargo xtask ci`.

Treat every GitHub Action `uses:` pin update as a potential validation-behavior
change, even when the workflow inputs remain unchanged. While evaluating a
candidate update, compare the Action at the current and candidate immutable
SHAs, including its commands, inputs and defaults, runtime, and transitive
`uses:` dependencies. Determine whether those changes affect the local
`cargo xtask ci` equivalent or this exact-command documentation. When an Action
update changes relevant behavior, reify it in hosted CI and, when applicable,
the xtask command plan and this file in the same change. Document any
intentional hosted-versus-local difference without making the xtask depend on
the hosted provider's configuration.

Keep maintenance commands such as `cargo xtask update-acvp` separate from CI
unless hosted validation explicitly needs them.

## Coordinated Buf upgrades

Publishing a new `buf-tools` or `buf-toolchain` release does not automatically
update this repository. Coordinate Buf upgrades with `yaml-sigil-rs` and
`yaml-sigil-traits`, and update every applicable pin and verification surface
in one reviewed change.

This repository currently has no product `buf-tools` dependency. Reconfirm
that before an upgrade, but do not add or update a product dependency without
source evidence that it is required. The applicable surfaces here are the
trusted and candidate `bufbuild/buf-action` steps under `.github/workflows/`
and the rolling local `buf-toolchain` prerequisite. The Action's immutable SHA
and its Buf CLI `version` input are separate controls. Keep both hosted paths
aligned with the selected CLI version, and report any omitted `version` input
as a consistency gap. A repository `buf.lock` locks BSR or module dependencies,
not the installed CLI, so do not update it solely for a CLI or Rust helper
upgrade.

For each future coordinated upgrade:

- Review the selected Buf, `buf-tools`, and `buf-toolchain` releases and their
  published mapping.
- Update every applicable pin in one coordinated change, and regenerate only
  Cargo lockfiles that the affected repositories already commit.
- Confirm that no unplanned protobuf-generated output changed.
- Run the local Cargo and reporter/materializer suites, ShellCheck or Shuck,
  actionlint, and Markdown checks.
- Require successful trusted and App-owned candidate CI at the exact reviewed
  heads.
- Confirm that candidate CI retained no artifacts.

## Style guide

Applies to normative and maintenance Markdown: repository-root spec
documents, `schema/`, `algorithms/`, `conformance/` (including
per-subdirectory `README.md` files), `DIAGRAM.md`, and proto-adjacent
companions. **Exempt:** `original-readme.md`. That file keeps its own voice;
do not rewrite it to satisfy this guide unless the author explicitly asks.

Write like you are explaining something to a colleague. Be direct,
specific, and concise. This repository is a specification, not
application code; the audience is implementers, auditors, and reviewers
who need unambiguous rules, not marketing copy.

Terminology is defined in [README](./README.md)'s glossary and in the
**Naming** section below. Use those forms consistently; do not invent
synonyms for glossary entries.

The Markdown dialect target is GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), as
rendered by GitHub repository views. Rely on GitHub's generated
document outline for navigation. Avoid renderer-specific inline
attributes such as `{width=50%}` in new content unless the file
explicitly targets a separate renderer.

### Voice and tone

- Use active voice. "Decompose returns `Unsigned`" not "`Unsigned` is
  returned by Decompose."
- Use second person ("you") when addressing the reader.
- Use present tense. "Verification returns `MalformedAttemptedSigned`"
  not "Verification will return …"
- State facts. Do not hedge with "simply," "just," "easily," or "of
  course."
- RFC 2119 keywords (`MUST`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`, and so on) are normative
  when used in that sense; do not soften or decorate them.

### Things to avoid

These patterns are common in LLM-generated text and erode trust with
technical readers. Remove them during review.

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unnecessary bold | "This is a **critical** step" on routine instructions. | Reserve bold for glossary terms (per README), genuine warnings, and rare emphasis. Prefer `code` for field names, states, and wire identifiers. |
| Em dashes everywhere | "The carrier — which is markerless — crosses the API boundary." | Use commas or split into two sentences. Em dashes are fine sparingly but should not appear multiple times per paragraph. |
| Superlatives | "YamlSigil provides a robust, seamless signing experience." | Say what the format does, not how great it is. |
| Hedge words | "Simply invoke Decompose" or "You can easily verify …" | Drop the adverb. "Invoke Decompose." |
| Emoji in prose | Decorative emoji in specification Markdown. | No emoji in normative prose. |
| Rhetorical questions | "Need byte-identical decomposition? Read on!" | State the purpose directly. |

### Formatting rules

- End every sentence with a period.
- Use `code` formatting for protobuf message and field names, enum
  values, verifier states, YAML mapping keys (`schema`, `alg`,
  `keyid`, `signature`), file paths, and literal octet or wire values.
- Use fenced `yaml` blocks for artifact layout examples, `protobuf` or
  `text` for wire layouts and transcripts, and `shell` for copyable
  tooling commands (`buf`, `cargo`, `jq`, `rumdl`). Do not prefix
  shell commands with `$`:

  ```shell
  buf build proto
  buf lint proto
  buf format proto --diff --exit-code
  ```

- Use tables for structured comparisons (enum mappings, stage
  attribution, fixture inventories). Keep tables simple (no nested
  formatting).
- Use GitHub Flavored Markdown alert notices for non-normative notes
  and implementation asides when the content benefits from a visible
  notice label. Supported labels are `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`,
  `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, and `> [!CAUTION]`. Use plain
  Markdown blockquotes (`>`) for lower-emphasis asides. Do not use bold
  callouts or documentation-framework components this repository does
  not use.
- Do not number section titles. Write "Artifact Decomposition" not
  "Section 3: Artifact Decomposition."
- Do not use colons in titles. Write "Conformance Profiles" not
  "Profiles: Conformance."
- Use colons only to introduce a list. Do not use colons as
  general-purpose punctuation between clauses.
- When editing in-scope Markdown, run `rumdl check` and fix reported
  layout issues. Do not break emphasis (`*…*`, `**…**`) or
  `[markdown](links)` across line wraps.

### Word list

Use the [README glossary](./README.md#glossary) forms. Common
substitutions and casing:

| Use | Do not use |
| --- | --- |
| **Artifact** (glossary term) | conflating "artifact" with unrelated senses without definition |
| **Payload stream**, **Signature document**, **Signature carrier**, **Verified payload bytes**, **Artifact Decomposition** | ad-hoc synonyms (`body`, `footer`, `sig block`, …) |
| **Transcription**, **Transcoding** (glossary processes) | transcription / transcoding when naming the defined process |
| Signing API, Transcription API, Verification API | signing api, the transcription layer (when naming the spec surface) |
| `YamlSigil.v1alpha1` | Yaml Sigil, YAML Sigil (for the overall specification name) |
| `YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1` | conflating with the protobuf package alone |
| `yaml_sigil.v1alpha1` (protobuf package) | `nvidia.ddurst.yaml_sigil.v1alpha1`, `YamlSigil.v1alpha1` (as package name) |
| `SignedYamlArtifact`, `YamlSigilSignature` (message types) | signed yaml artifact (prose without `code`) |
| `Verified`, `Unsigned`, `MalformedAttemptedSigned`, `SignedButAlgorithmUnsupported`, `SignedButFailedVerification` | paraphrased verifier outcomes |
| YAML | yaml, Yaml (for the format name) |
| protobuf | Protobuf (unless starting a sentence) |
| JSON Schema | json schema, Json Schema |
| NVIDIA | Nvidia, nvidia |
| `keyid` | key ID, KeyId (for the signature-document field) |
| canonical `alg` strings (README table) | `ALGORITHM_…` prefixed spellings in YAML-form discussion |

Protobuf IDL discussion may use Buf-style prefixed enum names where the
IDL requires it; spec-level YAML discussion uses unprefixed canonical
`alg` strings per README.

## Naming

Two names appear together throughout the documents and should not be
confused:

- **`YamlSigil.v1alpha1`** — the overall specification name.
  Used to identify this format as a whole.
- **`YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1`** — the schema/message name for
  the contents of the signature document. The `schema:` field inside a
  signature document carries this value. In the protobuf form, the
  corresponding message type is `YamlSigilSignature`.

The overall specification is `YamlSigil.v1alpha1`; the structured
metadata that lives inside the signature document is
`YamlSigilSignature.v1alpha1`.
